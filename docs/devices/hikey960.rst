Hikey960
========

Hikey960 until recently was a supported dev-board in AOSP. Since it is no
longer marked as supported, this initiative will keep it working with AOSP
and relevant kernels.

More details about the dev-board can be found at the `96boards page 
<https://www.96boards.org/product/hikey960/>`_.

- `Documentation <https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/hikey/hikey960/hardware-docs/hardware-user-manual.md.html>`_
- Kernel source code - TBD
- `AOSP device config  <https://android.googlesource.com/device/linaro/hikey/>`_
- `prebuilt kernels <https://android.googlesource.com/device/linaro/hikey-kernel/>`_
- Local manifest - TBD
- `Vendor binary blobs <http://releases.devboardsforandroid.linaro.org/vendor-packages>`_
    - This was required as a binary package when the board was hosted at AOSP.
      It will be updated to use vendor files via the manifest instead.
