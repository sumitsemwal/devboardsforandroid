For familiarity and uniformity with the AOSP development process, Gerrit-based
review and merge process is followed for dev-boards that have their source code
hosted here.

To submit contributions, please use
`devboardsforandroid Gerrit server <https://gerrit.devboardsforandroid.linaro.org/>`_.

For communities around existing devices that already have a process for their
contributions, reviewing and merging, we can continue to follow the same.
